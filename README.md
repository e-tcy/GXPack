# <h1> why are you here? </h1>
<h2 align=left>
A better program to use instead of this trash and outdated hobby bat project is 
<a href="https://github.com/marticliment/UniGetUI/releases/latest">
UniGetUI (WinGetUI)
</a>
.

# <h1> what's this lol </h1>
<h2 align=left>
GX_ Pack is a bat script that i made while testing my laptop.
<br>
Got bored of installing stuff and clicking "yes" everywhere,
<br>
So i made them install apps silently.
</h2>

# <h1> so what does it use? </h1>
<h2>
The app uses 
<a href="https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/1.21.4/64/wget.exe">
WGET
</a> 
and 
<a href="https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2407-extra.7z">
7z
</a>
binaries for downloading and extracting (if needed) respectfully.
<br>
Versions are slightly outdated because i don't care enough to constantly update them and i don't test my laptop that often now.
